Old versions of Space Domination

I originally bought an old version of Star Dart from Fred of Fred's Friends. He was kind enough to support the aspiring dreams of a young kid.


Together, myself and Destroyer turned that old version of Star Dart into Space Domination. I was just learning Java at the time, so my contributions were mostly the hosting and the site. Destroyer was the guy actually fixing bugs and implementing new features.


The client included in these zips is a Java applet - now an outdated tech. In order to run the game, you're going to need some technical knowledge.


There is currently a different version of Space Domination running at https://www.spacedomination.org/
